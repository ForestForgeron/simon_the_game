# simon_the_game

My own realization of this game with Vue 3. 

- to start press "Start" button
-to reset press "Reset" button

In each round the game shows you a sequence of lights, which you have to repeat.

Don't be affraid to press the button by accident when the game sequence is playing. The buttons are blocked when it's happening to prevent confusion:)

There are 10 rounds, and scores off course. 

Music is from good old game Mario, and I hope it will refresh warm memories from the childhood:)

Have fun and Good Luck!:)
